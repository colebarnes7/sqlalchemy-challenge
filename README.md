# sqlalchemy-challenge
This repository contains a database containing information regarding precipitation and temperature observations from weather stations in Hawaii. This database is worked through using SQLalchemy inside a Jupyter Notebook and data is extracted and plotted in queries. These same queries are then used inside a python file to create both static and dynamic API routes using flask.
